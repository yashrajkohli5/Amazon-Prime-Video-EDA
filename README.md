# Amazon-Prime-Video-EDA
A comprehensive Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) and visualization project using Python to uncover trends, distributions, and content patterns within the Amazon Prime Video library.

## Project Overview
This project analyzes the Amazon Prime dataset to identify key content trends, such as the evolution of content releases over time, the distribution of age ratings, and the balance between Movies and TV Shows.

The analysis utilizes Matplotlib, Seaborn, and Plotly to create high-visibility charts, specifically addressing challenges like visualizing low-frequency rating categories and content duration trends.

## Key Features
Temporal Analysis: Line plots showing the volume of content added per year and total duration in minutes.

Rating Distribution: Advanced count plots that ensure even low-count ratings (fewer than 10 entries) are clearly visible.

Comparative Insights: Side-by-side comparisons of Movies vs. TV Shows across different genres and ratings.

Data Preparation: Grouping and unstacking techniques to handle multi-categorical data (Year vs. Rating).

## Visualizations Included
Rating Distribution by Type: A refined countplot with separated bars and adjusted labeling for maximum clarity.

Yearly Trends: Interactive or static plots showing the growth of the Prime library over time.

Content Composition: Breakdown of ratings like TV-MA, PG-13, and others to understand target audience demographics.

## Technologies Used
Python 3.x

Pandas: For data manipulation and multi-index grouping.

Seaborn/Matplotlib: For static, high-quality statistical visualizations.

Plotly: (Optional) For interactive data exploration.

## Key Insights
Analyzed the distribution of content ratings to identify the primary target audience.

Identified specific years with peak content releases.

Visualized the relationship between content type (Movie/TV Show) and viewer ratings.
